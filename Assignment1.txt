CS 520Assignment 1The goal of this assignment is to use the operating system interface for characterizing the performancecharacteristics of our linux-lab cluster machines.ProblemsYou are required to write one C language (or C++ if you like) program for each of the following performanceareas. You program should determine the performance values using some set of system calls and compu-tational activities. Figuring out a strategy to estimate or measure the required performance metric mayrequire some thinking and some creativity. You should estimate/measure the following aspects of systemperformance: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 marks1. Context switching time.2. Process creation time.3. Process switching time4. Thread creation time.5. Thread switching time.6. Disk bandwidth with serial I/O and random I/O. Chose a few dierent types of random I/O. Observeand explain the dierences.SubmissionSubmissions should be made throough elearn. You can use tar.gz or zip formats to make the submission.Late submissions will be penalized with a late penalty of 3 marks per day. Your submission should include aMakele that can build all your programs. It should also have a README le explaining what is containedin the submitted les.You should also submit a report explaining what your programs do, and why their execution measuresthe required performance metric. You should submit your observations and describe the observed meansand standard deviations in your measurements. You should discuss your observations, and draw appropriateconclusions from them.GradingGrading will depend on the correctness of your programs, how well your programs measure the performance,the quality of documentation, lack of warnings and other software problems. Credit will also be given forhow well you summarize, discuss, and explain your experimental results.Note: Plagiarism will result in you getting 0 marks. Plagiarism will be detected using an automatictool, and suspected cases will be reported for punishment according to the honor code.
